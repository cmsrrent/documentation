What we wont cover
CI

reduce regression time
act as the tester if the tester isnt around
automation doesnt solve everything - its not great for exploratory or UI checking
give quicker feedback to devs on state of changes
worst case scenario - minor change - is everything ok?! software upgrade / aa test
automate repeatable tasks
automate test scenarios
dev skillset + testers mindset
both types of people transition into the automation engineer role

automation keeps evolving (webdriver on release 3)

1 - Learn to code
2 - automation layers ui, mobile apps, webservices (microservices), unit tests
over 4000 jobs for test automation BDD most jobs looking for webdriver

BDD is not automation, its a process to define what behaviour in a system should be tested features BEFORE development - writing feature files that ultimately become auotomation tests
